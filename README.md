# Oracle Database Projects

Welcome to my **Oracle Database Projects** repository! This collection showcases my hands-on experience with Oracle databases, covering foundational and advanced concepts implemented through various projects.

## üóÇÔ∏è Projects Overview

### 1. **Database Architecture and Management**
- Scripts demonstrating Oracle server architecture principles:
  - Background processes and server components.
  - Tablespace creation and management (logical and physical storage).
- Example for startup and shutdown operations (including initialization parameters).

### 2. **User and Security Management**
- SQL scripts for creating users and assigning privileges.
- Implementation of roles, profiles, and security best practices.

### 3. **Schema Design and Data Operations**
- Designing schemas and managing data through DDL and DML commands:
  - **DDL:** Table creation, altering, and schema updates.
  - **DML:** Insert, Update, Delete, and Query operations.
- Examples of transactions (commit, rollback) and maintaining read consistency.

### 4. **Backup, Recovery, and Flashback**
- Implementation of Oracle flashback technologies for recovery scenarios.
- Backup and recovery scripts for disaster management.

### 5. **PL/SQL Projects**
- Use of PL/SQL for creating:
  - Stored procedures and functions.
  - Triggers for automating database tasks.
- Use of sequences for unique value generation.

### 6. **Advanced Concepts**
- Scripts for:
  - Implementing ANSI-SPARC three-tier architecture.
  - Pluggable database setup.
  - Increasing tablespace sizes dynamically.
